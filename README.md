# Odins-Calculator

created a calculator for my odin project using vanilla javascript and OOP. Used the websites color scheme for the buttons and ouput colors. Hope you like it! :)

Keyboard tips: 
1. space is used to clear ouput
2. backspace and del is used to delete last input
3. enter and equal computes output.
